It is trained on large datasets to learn relationships between different modalities and fuse them effectively. It can perform tasks like image captioning, text-to-image generation, video understanding, human-computer interaction, and robot interaction, offering significant potential for real-world applications.\nHere are some examples,\nChatGPT offers multimodal capabilities, allowing users to interact with the chatbot in various ways. Users can upload images as prompts, which the chatbot uses to generate responses. Voice input is also available for hands-free tasks, and responses can be generated in one of five natural-sounding voices. Additionally, ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise users can generate images from text descriptions directly within the ChatGPT interface with the DALL-E GPT.\nGoogle Gemini is gaining popularity in the AI space, in certain areas due to its fresh data. Gemini integrates with various data sources like Google Flights, Maps, Hotels, Workspace, and YouTube. Its dynamic communication with tools like Maps and Hotels allows for real-time updates on queries related to those topics.\n\nUse Cases:\nPersonalized Nutrition: The USDA‚Äôs MyPlate allows individuals to plan their meals based on various factors such as age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level. Future plans could include additional data like blood test results, health questionnaires, genotype, or microbiome. Important features need to be identified using large clinical studies with advanced feature selection methods. The USDA Nutritional Penotyping study includes over 5000 variables from self-reporting diet questionnaires and blood tests, and millions from high-throughput ‚Äúomics‚Äù analyses. ML analyses of this data can serve two purposes: developing a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between diet and health and developing personalized nutrition models to predict health effects.\nMedical Images: M-LLMs are advanced medical imaging tools that can improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in various image modalities like x-rays, MRI scans, CT scans, positron emission tomography scans, ultrasound images, digital pathology slides, and retinal images. These tools provide unique insights into the body‚Äôs internal structures, aiding in early disease detection, diagnosis, and monitoring. For example, in radiology, M-LLMs analyze CT and MRI images to identify anomalies and generate automated reports. They also allow annotation and tagging of medical images with keywords, enabling additional analytics applications. In pathology, they interpret tissue sample slides to identify disease markers. In dermatology, they assess skin lesions for early detection of skin cancers.\nAI Personalised Nutritions"

Doctors can concentrate on building relationships with their patients by automating administrative duties and taking clinical notes during patient consultations.\nAutonomous cars: In autonomous cars, an agentic AI system not only recognizes objects but also forecasts how other drivers and pedestrians will behave. It makes decisions in real time, plans routes, and avoids barriers using this information. Agentic AI systems exhibit a degree of ‚Äúintelligent agency‚Äù that surpasses data processing by fusing perception and action, giving them a special capability.\nReal-Time Threat Detection: Agentic AI systems can detect real-time threats by analyzing video streams to identify anomalies like unauthorized access or unusual movement patterns. They can autonomously recognize trespassers and alert security personnel, integrating object detection and behavioural analysis for accurate and timely interventions."

The intention is to assist users comprehend how an AI model generates results or makes predictions. An AI system whose core operations are hidden from the user is known as an AI black box. The AI model doesn‚Äôt give any justification for its decisions.\nFor instance, you might not understand why an AI model accurately classifies an image. Scientists and engineers dislike ‚Äúblack boxes.‚Äù They‚Äôre curious about what‚Äôs going on within the box. Explainable AI seeks to reveal mysteries. Explainability strategies aid in demonstrating the rationale behind and possibly the process by which the AI model arrived at its conclusion.\nExplainable AI techniques, such as Grad-CAM, LIME, and occlusion sensitivity, are useful when using models that are not inherently explainable, such as deep learning models. These techniques help users gain confidence in AI decisions and can be useful when comparing the performance of multiple models. The mapping of important features slightly differs between explainability techniques due to the underlying methodology. LIME approximates complex model behaviour using a simpler model, while Grad-CAM uses gradients of classification score to determine the importance of features in the deep learning model. Occlusion sensitivity computes a map of the change in activation when parts of the input are occluded with a mask.\nAs AI technology advances, it is increasingly used to solve real-world problems, and explainability techniques are crucial to ensure trust in the decisions of the model and its functionality.\n\nUse Cases:\nOptimize Clinical Decision Support: The study aimed to improve alert criteria using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches. Data was extracted from Vanderbilt University Medical Center alerts from 2019 to 2020, and machine learning models were developed to predict user responses. XAI techniques were applied to generate global and local explanations. The final dataset included 2,991‚Äì823 firings with 2689 features. The LightGBM model achieved the highest Area under the ROC Curve, identifying 96 helpful suggestions. A total of 278‚Äì807 firings (9.3%) could have been eliminated. Some suggestions also revealed workflow and education issues. The study aims to identify improvements in clinical decision support (CDS) and improve quality by identifying scenarios where CDS alerts are not accepted due to workflow, education, or staffing issues."

One of the key limitations of generative AI, often highlighted by researchers, is what‚Äôs known as ‚ÄòAI hallucinations.‚Äô While these systems are remarkable in generating coherent and contextually appropriate content, there are instances where their outputs can be misleading or outright inaccurate.\nIt would need human-level comprehension and reasoning to fully resolve hallucinations. Consider this: In order to prevent hallucinations, a system would have to:\nHave the ability to achieve various goals and perform tasks in various contexts and environments.\nCapable of handling problems and situations different from those anticipated by its creators.\nCapable of generalizing knowledge to transfer it across different problems or contexts.\nIn essence, these qualities are what we refer to as ‚Äúgeneral intelligence‚Äù. However, arbitrary general intelligence is not possible due to realistic resource constraints. Real-world systems may display limited generality but are more efficient at learning certain tasks, making them somewhat biased towards certain goals and environments. It is unlikely that humans manifest a maximal level of general intelligence, even in relation to their evolutionarily adapted goals and environments.\nAn AI would have attained human-like comprehension and reasoning skills if it could actually overcome hallucinations. By then, we would have something that was close to artificial general intelligence (AGI), not merely a more accurate language model.\n\nUse Cases:\nSmart Homes: The Whisper model has revolutionized speech recognition, delivering exceptional accuracy in multilingual recognition, translation, and language identification. This allows for more intuitive interactions between users and smart home systems, bridging the gap between human language and technology. VALL-E, a text-to-speech synthesis model, uses semi-supervised data to produce personalized, high-quality speech, enhancing communication quality and adaptability. These advancements bring us closer to AGI-powered smart homes that are natural, tailored, and responsive.\nSmart Healthcare: AGI technology can be applied to wearable health devices, enabling real-time data processing to detect vital signs anomalies. This technology can prompt interventions and improve patient care. A Smart Healthcare System integrates IoT and AGI, analyzing data for continuous monitoring and disease prediction."

    "text": "Conditional Probability\nLet us try to answer this question by taking up a random experiment in which the outcomes are equally likely to occur.\nConsider the experiment of tossing three fair coins. The sample space of the experiment is S = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}\nSince the coins are fair, we can assign the probability \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) to each sample point. Let \\(E\\) be the event ‚Äúat least two heads appear‚Äù and \\(F\\) be the event ‚Äúfirst coin shows tail‚Äù. Then:\n\n\\(E = \\{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH\\}\\)\n\\(F = \\{THH, THT, TTH, TTT\\}\\)\n\nTherefore:\n\nThe probability of \\(E\\) is the sum of the probabilities of its sample points:\n\\[\nP(E) = P(\\{HHH\\}) + P(\\{HHT\\}) + P(\\{HTH\\}) + P(\\{THH\\})\\]\n\\[= \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nThe reason for this calculation is that each of these outcomes is equally likely, and there are four outcomes where at least two heads appear.\nThe probability of \\(F\\) is the sum of the probabilities of its sample points:\n\\[\nP(F) = P(\\{THH\\}) + P(\\{THT\\}) + P(\\{TTH\\}) + P(\\{TTT\\})\\]\n\\[= \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nThe intersection of \\(E\\) and \\(F\\), denoted \\(E \\cap F\\), contains only the outcome where the first coin shows a tail and at least two heads appear:\n\\[\nE \\cap F = \\{THH\\}\n\\]\nTherefore, the probability of \\(E \\cap F\\) is:\n\\[\nP(E \\cap F) = P(\\{THH\\}) = \\frac{1}{8}\\]\n\nNow, suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail, i.e.¬†F occurs, then what is the probability of occurrence of E? With the information of occurrence of F, we are sure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered while finding the probability of E. This information reduces our sample space from the set S to its subset F for the event E. In other words, the additional information really amounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new random experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only which are favourable to the occurrence of the event F. Now, the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH.\nNow, suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail, i.e.¬†F occurs, then what is the probability of occurrence of E?\nWith the information of occurrence of F, we are sure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered while finding the probability of E. This information reduces our sample space from the set S to its subset F for the event E.\nIn other words, the additional information really amounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new random experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only which are favourable to the occurrence of the event F.\nNow, the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH.\nThus, the probability of \\(E\\) considering \\(F\\) as the sample space is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). The probability of \\(E\\) given that the event \\(F\\) has occurred is also \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). This probability of the event \\(E\\) is called the conditional probability of \\(E\\) given that \\(F\\) has already occurred, and is denoted by \\(P(E|F)\\). Thus,\n\\[\nP(E|F) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\nNote that the elements of \\(F\\) which favor the event \\(E\\) are the common elements of \\(E\\) and \\(F\\), i.e., the sample points of \\(E \\cap F\\). Thus, we can also write the conditional probability of \\(E\\) given that \\(F\\) has occurred as:\n\\[\nP(E|F) = \\frac{\\text{Number of elementary events favorable to } E \\cap F}{\\text{Number of elementary events favorable to } F}\n\\]\nDividing the numerator and the denominator by the total number of elementary events of the sample space, we see that \\(P(E|F)\\) can also be written as:\n\\[\nP(E|F) = \\frac{n(E \\cap F)}{n(F)} = \\frac{n(E \\cap F) / n(S)}{n(F) / n(S)} = \\frac{P(E \\cap F)}{P(F)}\n\\]\nNote that this formula is valid only when \\(P(F) \\neq 0\\), i.e., \\(F \\neq \\phi\\). This is because division by zero is undefined, and if \\(P(F) = 0\\), it means that the event \\(F\\) is impossible, so it cannot be used as a condition for calculating conditional probability.\nThus, we can define the conditional probability as follows:\nIf \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are two events associated with the same sample space of a random experiment, the conditional probability of the event \\(E\\) given that \\(F\\) has occurred, i.e., \\(P(E|F)\\), is given by:\n\\[\nP(E|F) = \\frac{P(E \\cap F)}{P(F)}\n\\]\nprovided that \\(P(F) \\neq 0\\)."

    "text": "Bayes‚Äô Theorem\nConsider that there are two bags I and II. Bag I contains 2 white and 3 red balls and Bag II contains 4 white and 5 red balls.\nOne ball is drawn at random from one of the bags.\nWe can find the probability of selecting any of the bags (i.e.¬†1/2 ) or probability of drawing a ball of a particular colour (say white) from a particular bag (say Bag I).\nIn other words, we can find the probability that the ball drawn is of a particular colour, if we are given the bag from which the ball is drawn. But, can we find the probability that the ball drawn is from a particular bag (say Bag II), if the colour of the ball drawn is given?\nHere, we have to find the reverse probability of Bag II to be selected when an event occurred after it is known.\nFamous mathematician, John Bayes‚Äô solved the problem of finding reverse probability by using conditional probability. The formula developed by him is known as ‚ÄòBayes theorem‚Äô which was published posthumously in 1763. Before stating and proving the Bayes‚Äô theorem, let us first take up a definition and some preliminary results.\nA set of events \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_n\\) is said to represent a partition of the sample space \\(S\\) if:\n\n\\(E_i \\cap E_j = \\phi\\), for \\(i \\neq j\\), where \\(i, j = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n\\).

This means that each event has a nonzero probability.\n\nIn other words, the events \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_n\\) represent a partition of the sample space \\(S\\) if they are pairwise disjoint, exhaustive, and have nonzero probabilities.\nAs an example, we see that any nonempty event \\(E\\) and its complement \\(E'\\) form a partition of the sample space \\(S\\) since they satisfy \\(E \\cap E' = \\phi\\) and \\(E \\cup E' = S\\).\nFrom the Venn diagram, one can easily observe that if \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are any two events associated with a sample space \\(S\\), then the set \\(\\{E \\cap F', E \\cap F, E' \\cap F, E' \\cap F'\\}\\) is a partition of the sample space \\(S\\).\nIt may be mentioned that the partition of a sample space is not unique. There can be several partitions of the same sample space. We shall now prove a theorem known as Theorem of total probability.\nTheorem of Total Probability:\nLet \\(\\{E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_n\\}\\) be a partition of the sample space \\(S\\), and suppose that each of the events \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_n\\) has a nonzero probability of occurrence. Let \\(A\\) be any event associated with \\(S\\). Then, the probability of \\(A\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\nP(A) = P(E_1)P(A|E_1) + P(E_2)P(A|E_2) + \\ldots + P(E_n)P(A|E_n)\n\\]\nAlternatively, using summation notation:\n\\[\nP(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(E_i)P(A|E_i)\n\\]\nWe shall now state and prove Bayes‚Äô Theorem.\nBayes‚Äô Theorem:\nIf \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_n\\) are \\(n\\) non-empty events that constitute a partition of the sample space \\(S\\), i.e., \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_n\\) are pairwise disjoint and \\(E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup E_n = S\\), and \\(A\\) is any event of nonzero probability, then:\n\\[\nP(E_i|A) = \\frac{P(E_i)P(A|E_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} P(E_j)P(A|E_j)}\n\\]\nfor any \\(i = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n\\).\nProof:\nBy the formula of conditional probability, we know that:\n\\[\nP(E_i|A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap E_i)}{P(A)}\n\\]\nUsing the multiplication rule of probability, we have:\n\\[\nP(A \\cap E_i) = P(E_i)P(A|E_i)\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\nP(E_i|A) = \\frac{P(E_i)P(A|E_i)}{P(A)}\n\\]\nBy the theorem of total probability, we know that:\n\\[\nP(A) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} P(E_j)P(A|E_j)\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the expression for \\(P(E_i|A)\\) gives:\n\\[\nP(E_i|A) = \\frac{P(E_i)P(A|E_i)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} P(E_j)P(A|E_j)}\n\\]\nRemark:\nThe following terminology is generally used when Bayes‚Äô theorem is applied. The events \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_n\\) are called hypotheses. The probability \\(P(E_i)\\) is called the a priori probability of the hypothesis \\(E_i\\). The conditional probability \\(P(E_i|A)\\) is called the a posteriori probability of the hypothesis \\(E_i\\). Bayes‚Äô theorem is also called the formula for the probability of ‚Äúcauses‚Äù. Since the \\(E_i\\)‚Äôs are a partition of the sample space \\(S\\), one and only one of the events \\(E_i\\) occurs (i.e., one of the events \\(E_i\\) must occur and only one can occur). Hence, the above formula gives us the probability of a particular \\(E_i\\) (i.e., a ‚Äúcause‚Äù), given that the event \\(A\\) has occurred. Bayes‚Äô theorem has its applications in a variety of situations, a few of which are illustrated in the following examples.\nLet‚Äôs consider an example,\nBag I contains 3 red and 4 black balls, while another Bag II contains 5 red and 6 black balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the bags and it is found to be red. We need to find the probability that it was drawn from Bag II.\nTake a shot at solving it by yourself first!!!\n\n\nThe moment of truth: here‚Äôs the solution!\n\nLet \\(E_1\\) be the event of choosing Bag I, \\(E_2\\) the event of choosing Bag II, and \\(A\\) be the event of drawing a red ball. Then:\n\n\\(P(E_1) = P(E_2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\\(P(A|E_1) = P(\\text{drawing a red ball from Bag I}) = \\frac{3}{7}\\)\n\\(P(A|E_2) = P(\\text{drawing a red ball from Bag II}) = \\frac{5}{11}\\)\n\nNow, the probability of drawing a ball from Bag II, given that it is red, is \\(P(E_2|A)\\). By using Bayes‚Äô theorem, we have:\n\\[\nP(E_2|A) = \\frac{P(E_2)P(A|E_2)}{P(E_1)P(A|E_1) + P(E_2)P(A|E_2)}\n\\]\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[\nP(E_2|A) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{11}}{\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{7} + \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{5}{11}}\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nP(E_2|A) = \\frac{\\frac{5}{22}}{\\frac{3}{14} + \\frac{5}{22}} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{22}}{\\frac{33 + 35}{154}} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{22}}{\\frac{68}{154}} = \\frac{5}{22} \\times \\frac{154}{68} = \\frac{5 \\times 7}{68} = \\frac{35}{68}\\]"
