    "Remark:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following terminology is generally used when Bayes' theorem is applied. The events $E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_n$ are called **hypotheses**. The probability $P(E_i)$ is called the **a priori probability** of the hypothesis $E_i$. The conditional probability $P(E_i|A)$ is called the **a posteriori probability** of the hypothesis $E_i$. Bayes' theorem is also called the formula for the probability of \"causes\". Since the $E_i$'s are a partition of the sample space $S$, one and only one of the events $E_i$ occurs (i.e., one of the events $E_i$ must occur and only one can occur). Hence, the above formula gives us the probability of a particular $E_i$ (i.e., a \"cause\"), given that the event $A$ has occurred. Bayes' theorem has its applications in a variety of situations, a few of which are illustrated in the following examples."
